full names. IEEEtran.bst will automatically abbreviate when it encounters

	abstract = "For a number of common configurations of points (lines) in the plane, we develop data structures in which insertions and deletions of points (or lines, respectively) can be processed rapidly, without sacrificing much of the efficiency of query answering which known static structures for these configurations attain. As a main result we establish a fully dynamic maintenance algorithm for convex hulls that can process insertions and deletions of single points in only O(log2 n) steps per transaction, where n is the number of points currently in the set. The algorithm has several intriguing applications, including the fact that the “trimmed” mean of a set of n points in the plane can be determined in only O(n log2 n) steps. Likewise, efficient algorithms are obtained for dynamically maintaining the common intersection of a set of half-spaces and for dynamically maintaining the maximal elements of a set of points. The results are all derived by means of one master technique, which is applied repeatedly and which captures an appropriate notion of “decomposability” for configurations closely related to the existence of divide-and-conquer solutions."

An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
