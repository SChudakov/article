EURO CG

#1
- the results are well known
- a good bachelor student can come up with the algorithm
- the pictures are not very clear
- grammatical errors
- not clear from the introduction what you are trying to achieve
- not clear definition of convex hull
- compute convex hull for 3 points is trivial
- red-black trees can be split/merged in O(log n) time and even faster datastructure

#2
- contribution seem to be interesting but is not clearly presented
- only one datatructure
- no definition of unified algorithmic environment
- interrelated problems sets not specified
- priniciple of devomposition is not specified
- jump to 2d wihought notification
- no real novelty because the paper combines well knows results
- avoid lines starts with variables names
- avoid using citation as object in sentence
- omit x2 when enumerating variables
- spell numbers up to 10
- + text imporvements
- topic is out of spope for the parer


SoCG

#1
- Experimental & Evaluation : good fit
- Title: parallel implementation of the 2d convex hull
- 40 years old results
- expreimental results are disappointing
- no comparison with existing code is performed
- software is not made available
- unclear method of removing buplicates in the array
- old citations

#2
- well known results
- red-black trees are more efficient than concatenable queue

#3
- comparison with other implementations is not available
